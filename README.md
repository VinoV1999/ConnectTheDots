# ConnectTheDots
    This is a simple javascript dual player game where you have to connect the three dots to win the game. The game is played on a 2x2 grid and each player takes turns to place their coins (Red or Blue). The first player to drag and connect three of their coins in a row (horizontal, vertical or diagonal) wins the game.
